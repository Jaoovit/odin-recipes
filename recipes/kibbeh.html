        <h2>Levant</h2>
        <p>In Levantine cuisine, a variety of dishes made with bulgur (cracked wheat) and minced lamb are called kibbeh. Aleppo is famous for having more than 17 different types.[15] These include kibbeh prepared with sumac (kibbe sumāqiyye), yogurt (kibbe labaniyye), quince (kibbe safarjaliyye), lemon juice (kibbe ḥāmḍa), pomegranate sauce, cherry sauce, and other varieties, such as the "disk" kibbeh (kibbe arāṣ), the "plate" kibbeh (kibbe biṣfīḥa or kibbe bṣēniyye) and the raw kibbeh (kibbeh nayyeh).</p>
        <h2>South America</h2>
        <p>On Colombia's Caribbean coast, the most local variations of the dish use ground beef instead of lamb, but the original recipe, or one with mixture of beef and lamb, can be found served by the large Lebanese and Syrian population of the zone.[19] The dish has acquired almost vernacular presence and is frequently served in social occasions at both Arab and non-Arab households. When served as an adopted local dish, it is offered often as a starter along with other regional delicacies, including empanadas, deditos and carimañolas.[20]</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour some water over the bulgur wheat just until covered and mix and set aside for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Next, caramelize some onions in olive oil in a large frying pan over low to medium heat until well browned, which takes about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to high and add in the ground lamb and cook until lightly browned and cooked throughout. Stir often.</li>
            <li>Stir in the spice blend, fresh basil, fresh mint, salt, and toasted pine nuts, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Transfer the bulgur to a food processor along with some onions and pulse on high speed until the onions are finely minced.</li>
            <li>Next, add the ground lamb, spices, fresh herbs, and salt, and pulse on high speed until it becomes smooth.</li>
            <li>Lightly dip your hands in some water and grab about a golf ball size of the processed meat and wheat and form a ball.</li>
            <li>Dip your thumb in some water and press in the center while rotating the meat to form a hollow cone-like shape.</li>
            <li>Spoon in the cooked lamb and caramelized onion mixture into the inside of the hollowed-out kibbeh shell.</li>
            <li>Pull up the sides of the kibbeh shell and pinch the top.</li>
            <li>Cupping your hands, roll the kibbeh to form a pointy cylinder-like shape or quenelle.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until all the ingredients have been used up and place them on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Fry the kibbeh in batches in a pan of neutral-flavored oil at 350° for 2 ½ to 3 minutes per side or until golden brown and cooked throughout.</li>
            <li>Drain on a rack-lined cookie sheet tray.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and serve with optional garlic yogurt sauce.</li>
        </ol>
