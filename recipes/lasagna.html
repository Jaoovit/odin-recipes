        <h2>The delicious history of lasagna</h2>
        <p>Lasagna, could there be a more perfect dish? It’s comfort food on steroids. Layers of cheese generously piled on top of decadent amounts of meat, and then smothered with a sauce that would bring tears to the most cynical Italian’s eyes. When you cut into this amazing concoction of bliss you often don’t think of the history behind lasagna. Surprisingly, lasagna did not originate in Italy.</p>
        <h2>Lasagna originated in Greece</h2>
        <p>We may never know the exact person who created lasagna. In fact, this dish was not named after an individual, but after a fermented noodle called laganon that was frequently used in ancient Greece where lasagna originated. In the beginning, lasagna was sprinkled with toppings, and eaten with a pointed stick. Unrecognizable by today’s standards, the only similarity between the two was the layering of pasta and sauce.</p>
